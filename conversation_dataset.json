Even there are the myths of Mechanical men in Ancient Greek and Egyptian Myths. Following are some milestones in the history of AI which defines the journey from the AI generation to till date development.\n\nYear 1943: The first work which is now recognized as AI was done by Warren McCulloch and Walter pits in 1943. They proposed a model of artificial neurons.\nYear 1949: Donald Hebb demonstrated an updating rule for modifying the connection strength between neurons. His rule is now called Hebbian learning.\nYear 1950: The Alan Turing who was an English mathematician and pioneered Machine learning in 1950. Alan Turing publishes \"Computing Machinery and Intelligence\" in which he proposed a test. The test can check the machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior equivalent to human intelligence, called a Turing test.",
                "The birth of Artificial Intelligence (1952-1956)\nYear 1955: An Allen Newell and Herbert A. Simon created the \"first artificial intelligence program\"Which was named as \"Logic Theorist\". This program had proved 38 of 52 Mathematics theorems, and find new and more elegant proofs for some theorems.\nYear 1956: The word \"Artificial Intelligence\" first adopted by American Computer scientist John McCarthy at the Dartmouth Conference. For the first time, AI coined as an academic field.\n\nAt that time high-level computer languages such as FORTRAN, LISP, or COBOL were invented. And the enthusiasm for AI was very high at that time."

The term has become more popular due to recent advances in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.\n\nMachine learning is the area of artificial intelligence where machines are responsible for completing daily tasks and are believed to be smarter than humans.\n\nThey are known to learn, adapt and perform much faster than humans and are programmed to do so. Robotics and integration with IoT devices have taken machines to think and work to a new level where they out-perform humans in their cognitive abilities and smarts.",

And it's not like you have to go through to be able to use these fancy tech gadgets. You can look around, and I'm sure most of your work is smoothed out by artificial intelligence.\nIts importance lies in making our life easier. These technologies are a great asset to humans and are programmed to minimize human effort as much as possible. They can operate in an automated fashion. Therefore, manual intervention is the last thing that can be sought or seen during the operation of parts involving this technology.\nThese machines speed up your tasks and processes with guaranteed accuracy and precision, making them a useful and valuable tool. Apart from making the world an error-free place with their simple and everyday techniques, these technologies and applications are not only related to our ordinary and everyday life. It is affecting and holds importance for other domains as well."

It will continue to act as a technological innovator in the coming years. In just a few years, AI has become a reality from fantasy. Machines that help humans with intelligence are not just in sci-fi movies but also in the real world. At this time, we live in a world of Artificial Intelligence that was just a story though for some years.\n\nWe are using AI technology in our daily lives either unknowingly or knowingly, and somewhere it has become a part of our life. Ranging from Alexa/Siri to Chatbots, everyone is carrying AI in their daily routine. The development and evolution of this technology are happening at a rapid pace. However, it was not as smooth and easy as it seemed to us. It has taken several years and lots of hard work & contributions of various people to take AI at this stage. Being so revolutionary technology, AI also deals with many controversies about its future and impact on Human beings. It may be dangerous, but also a great opportunity. AI will be deployed to enhance both defensive and offensive cyber operations. Additionally, new means of cyber-attack will be invented to take advantage of particular vulnerabilities of AI technology."
